One operating system function is managing the computer's resources. This includes its memory, file storage, central processing unit, disc drives & network connections. Any device that is plugged into the computer system or inside of the computer is managed by the operating system. When the computer gets turned on, the operating system becomes active and takes control of these resources.

Another operating system function is to establish a user interface. The user interface allows users to recieve & enter information. There are a variety of different user interfaces, including text user interface (TUI) & graphical user interface (GUI).

Executing and providing services for application software is also an operating system function.
This is the process where a virtual machine or computer reads & acts on the instructions from each specific computer program. Programs may be run by a user typing commands or without human interaction.
