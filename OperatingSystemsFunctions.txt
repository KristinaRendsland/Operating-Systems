One operating system function is managing the computer's resources.
This includes its memory, file storage, central processing unit, disc drives & network connections. 
Any device that is plugged into the computer system or inside of the computer is managed by the operating system.
When the computer gets turned on, the operating system becomes active and takes control of these resources.
